Module 2: F5 Application Visibility and Reporting
=================================================

In this module we will explore how to configure and use F5’s Application Visibility and Reporting to provide application reporting. Analytics (also called Application Visibility and Reporting) is a module on the BIG-IP® system that you can use to analyze the performance of services and applications. It provides detailed metrics such as transactions per second, server and client latency, request and response throughput, and sessions. You can view metrics for applications, virtual servers, pool members, URLs, specific countries, and additional detailed statistics about application traffic running through the BIG-IP system.

The labs in the module will focus on the high level features of AVR. 
These will include Analytics profiles, configuration and navigation of the AVR 
reports and information generated.
